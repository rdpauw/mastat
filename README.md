Code of Masterthesis

This repository contains the different R-scripts that were applied in the master thesis:

1.mainscript.R
This script contains the main code and outline of the project

2.getStability.R
A script that calculates the Nogueira's stability index (based on Nogueira, S., Sechidis, K., & Brown, G. (2017). On the Stability of Feature Selection Algorithms. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 18, 174-1.)

3.hypothesisTestCompareStabilities.R
A scrit that can estimate the difference between two stability measures based on a independent sample t-test. Based on (based on Nogueira, S., Sechidis, K., & Brown, G. (2017). On the Stability of Feature Selection Algorithms. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 18, 174-1.).

4.listfeats.R
Create a list of the selected features

5.summaryresults.R
